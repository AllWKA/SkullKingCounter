In case you're not familiar with it, it's a card game where you have to bet on how many rounds you think you'll win. If you guess correctly, you earn points, but if you go over or don't reach your bet, you lose points.

## How to use it

You can download it for Android [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=github.com.AllWKA&hl=es&gl=US)

You only need to input each player's bet for each round, and the points will be automatically calculated. At the end of round 10, the winner will be displayed.
